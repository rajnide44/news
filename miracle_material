"New &apos;Miracle Material&apos; Helps Scientists Break Solar Power Record"
,""
,"A solar power world record has been now broken with a &quot;miracle material&quot; called  perovskite. This material allowed researchers to pass the 30% efficiency barrier with silicon solar cells for the first time.<br><br>The research was undertaken by a team from various universities and institutes in the Netherlands. They used a tandem solar cell to complement traditional silicon-based cells. The latter have an energy conversion efficiency of around 22% and the properties of perovskite.<br><br>According to the researchers, achieving more than 30% efficiency with the tandem device marked &quot;a big step in accelerating the energy transition&quot; and would also help reduce dependency on fossil fuels.<br><br>Dr. Mehrdad Najafi from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) told The Independent that &quot;this type of solar cell features a highly transparent back contact that allows over 93 per cent of the near infrared light to reach the bottom device.&quot;<br><br>Perovskite has an array of uses and scientists think that this &quot;miracle material&quot; can help enable ultra-high-speed communications as well as improve the production of renewable energy.<br><br>Professor Gianluca Coletti, the programme manager of Tandem PV said that they know have all the ingredients to &quot;control the layers that are needed to reach over 30% efficiency.&quot;"
