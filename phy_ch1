,"<h3>1.1 WHAT IS PHYSICS?</h3>The nature around us is colourful and diverse. It contains phenomena of large varieties. The winds, the sands, the waters, the planets, the rainbow, heating of objects on rubbing, the function of a human body, the energy coming from the sun and the nucleus …… there are a large number of objects and events taking place around us.<br><br>Physics is the study of nature and its laws. We expect that all these different events in nature take place according to some basic laws and revealing these laws of nature from the observed events is physics. For example, the orbiting of the moon around the earth, falling of an apple from a tree and tides in a sea on a full moon night can all be explained if we know the Newton’s law of gravitation and Newton’s laws of motion. Physics is concerned with the basic rules which are applicable to all domains of life. Understanding of physics, therefore, leads to applications in many fields including bio and medical sciences.<br><br>The great physicist Dr R. P. Feynman has given a wonderful description of what is &quot;understanding the nature&quot;. Suppose we do not know the rules of chess but are allowed to watch the moves of the players. If we watch the game for a long time, we may make out some of the rules. With the knowledge of these rules we may try to understand why a player played a particular move. However, this may be a very difficult task. Even if we know all the rules of chess, it is not so simple to understand all the complications of a game in a given situation and predict the correct move. Knowing the basic rules is, however, the minimum requirement if any progress is to be made.<br><br>One may guess at a wrong rule by partially watching the game. The experienced player may make use of a rule for the first time and the observer of the game may get surprised. Because of the new move some of the rules guessed at may prove to be wrong and the observer will frame new rules.Physics goes the same way. The nature around us is like a big chess game played by Nature. The events in the nature are like the moves of the great game. We are allowed to watch the events of nature and guess at the basic rules according to which the events take place. We may come across new events which do not follow the rules guessed earlier and we may have to declare the old rules inapplicable or wrong and discover new rules.<br><br>Since physics is the study of nature, it is real. No one has been given the authority to frame the rules of physics. We only discover the rules that are operating in nature. Aryabhat, Newton, Einstein or Feynman are great physicists because from the observations available at that time, they could guess and frame the laws of physics which explained these observations in a convincing way. But there can be a new phenomenon any day and if the rules discovered by the great scientists are not able to explain this phenomenon, no one will hesitate to change these rules.<h3>1.2 PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS</h3>The description of nature becomes easy if we have the freedom to use mathematics. To say that the gravitational force between two masses is proportional to the product of the masses and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance apart, is more difficult than to write<br>&emsp;&emsp;F ∝ <sup>m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></sup>&ensp;&frasl;&ensp;<sub>r<sup>2</sup></sub>&emsp;&emsp; … (1.1)<br><br>Further, the techniques of mathematics such as algebra, trigonometry and calculus can be used to make predictions from the basic equations. Thus, if we know the basic rule (1.1) about the force between two particles, we can use the technique of integral calculus to find what will be the force exerted by a uniform rod on a particle placed on its perpendicular bisector.<br><br>&emsp;&ensp;Thus, mathematics is the language of physics. Without knowledge of mathematics it would be much more difficult to discover, understand and explain the laws of nature. The importance of mathematics in today’s world cannot be disputed. However, mathematics itself is not physics. We use a language to express our ideas. But the idea that we want to express has the main attention. If we are poor at grammar and vocabulary, it would be difficult for us to communicate our feelings but while doing so our basic interest is in the feeling that we want to express. It is nice to board a deluxe coach to go from Delhi to Agra, but the sweet memories of the deluxe coach and the video film shown on way are next to the prime goal of reaching Agra. “To understand nature” is physics, and mathematics is the deluxe coach to take us there comfortably. This relationship of physics and mathematics must be clearly understood and kept in mind while doing a physics course.<h3>1.3 UNITS </h3>&emsp;Physics describes the laws of nature. This description is quantitative and involves measurement and comparison of physical quantities. To measure a physical quantity we need some standard unit of that quantity. An elephant is heavier than a goat but exactly how many times ? This question can be easily answered if we have chosen a standard mass calling it a unit mass. If the elephant is 200 times the unit mass and the goat is 20 times we know that the elephant is 10 times heavier than the goat. If I have the knowledge of the unit length and some one says that Gandhi Maidan is 5 times the unit length from here, I will have the idea whether I should walk down to Gandhi Maidan or I should ride a rickshaw or I should go by a bus. Thus, the physical quantities are quantitatively expressed in terms of a unit of that quantity. The measurement of the quantity is mentioned in two parts, the first part gives how many times of the standard unit and the second part gives the name of the unit. Thus, suppose I have to study for 2 hours. The numeric part 2 says that it is 2 times of the unit of time and the second part hour says that the unit chosen here is an hour.<h3>Who Decides the Units ?</h3>How is a standard unit chosen for a physical quantity ? The first thing is that it should have international acceptance. Otherwise, everyone will choose his or her own unit for the quantity and it will be difficult to communicate freely among the persons distributed over the world. A body named Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures or CGPM also known as General Conference on Weight and Measures in English has been given the authority to decide the units by international agreement. It holds its meetings and any changes in standard units are communicated through the publications of the Conference.<h3>Fundamental and Derived Quantities</h3>There are a large number of physical quantities which are measured and every quantity needs a definition of unit. However, not all the quantities are  independent of each other. As a simple example, if a unit of length is defined, a unit of area is automatically obtained. If we make a square with its length equal to its breadth equal to the unit length, its area can be called the unit area. All areas can then be compared to this standard unit of area. Similarly, if a unit of length and a unit of time interval are defined, a unit of speed is automatically obtained. If a particle covers a unit length in unit time interval, we say that it has a unit speed. We can define a set of fundamental quantities as follows :<br>&emsp;(a) the fundamental quantities should be independent of each other, and <br>&emsp;(b) all other quantities may be expressed in terms of the fundamental quantities.<br><br>It turns out that the number of fundamental quantities is only seven. All the rest may be derived from these quantities by multiplication and division. Many different choices can be made for the fundamental quantities. For example, one can take speed and time as fundamental quantities. Length is then a derived quantity. If something travels at unit speed, the distance it covers in unit time interval will be called a unit distance. One may also take length and t me interval as the fundamental quantities and then speed will be a derived quantity. Several systems are in use over the world and in each system the fundamental quantities are selected in a particular way. The units defined for the fundamental quantities are called fundamental units and those obtained for the derived quantities are called the derived units.<br><br>&emsp;Fundamental quantities are also called base quantities.<h3>SI Units</h3>&emsp;&emps;In 1971 CGPM held its meeting and decided a system of units which is known as the International System of Units. It is abbreviated as SI from the French name Le Systéme International d′Unités. This system is widely used throughout the world. <br><br>Table (1.1) gives the fundamental quantities and their units in SI.<h3>Table 1.1 : Fundamental or Base Quantities</h3><table><tr><th><i><u>Quantity</u></i></th><th><i><u>Name of the Unit</u></i></th><th><i><u>Symbol</u></i></th></tr><tr><td>Length</td><td><b>metre</b></td><td>m</td></tr><tr><td>Mass</td><td><b>kilogram</b></td><td>kg</td></tr><tr><td>Time</td><td><b>second</b></td><td>s</td></tr><tr><td>Electric Current</td><td><b>ampere</b></td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>Thermodynamic Temperature</td><td><b>kelvin</b></td><td>K</td></tr><tr><td>Amount of Substance</td><td><b>mole</b></td><td>mol</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Intensity</td><td><b>candela</b></td><td>cd</td></tr></table><br><br>&emsp;Besides the seven fundamental units two supplementary units are defined. They are for plane angle and solid angle. The unit for plane angle is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid angle is steradian with the symbol sr.<h3>SI Prefixes</h3>The magnitudes of physical quantities vary over a wide range. We talk of separation between two protons inside a nucleus which is about 10<sup>–15</sup> m and the distance of a quasar from the earth which is about 10 26 m. The mass of an electron is 9.1 X 10<sup>-31</sup> kg and that of our galaxy is about 2.2 X 10<sup>41</sup> kg. The CGPM recommended standard prefixes for certain powers of 10. Table (1.2) shows these prefixes.<h3>Table 1.2 : SI prefixes</h3><table><tr><th><i><u>Power of 10</u></i></th><th><i><u>Prefix</u></i></th><th><i><u>Symbol</u></i></th></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><b>exa</b></td><td>E</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><b>peta</b></td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><b>tera</b></td><td>T</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><b>giga</b></td><td>G</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><b>mega</b></td><td>M</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><b>kilo</b></td><td>k</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><b>hecto</b></td><td>h</td></tr><td>1</td><td><b>deka</b></td><td>da</td></tr><tr><td>-1</td><td><b>deci</b></td><td>d</td></tr><tr><td>-2</td><td><b>centi</b></td><td>c</td></tr><tr><td>-3</td><td><b>milli</b></td><td>m</td></tr><tr><td>-6</td><td><b>micro</b></td><td>μ</td></tr><tr><td>-9</td><td><b>nano</b></td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>-12</td><td><b>pico</b></td><td>p</td></tr><tr><td>-15</td><td><b>femto</b></td><td>f</td></tr><tr><td>-18</td><td><b>atto</b></td><td>a</td></tr></table>"
